# Code Quiz HW4
The Code Quiz is composed of 5 questions, with a timer that starts counting down when the 'Start Quiz' button is clicked on the main page. 

For each wrong question, 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer and 20 points are deducted from the starting points of 100. 

The user can see the timer counting down on the top right corner of the screen at all times but not the points. 

Every question, when answered, displays whether the selected answer choice was correct or wrong before moving on to the next question. 

Once all questions are answered, the results page is shown, in this page the user can see their points, the timer is stopped, and then will input their initials to save their score on the Highscores page, shown as soon as the user submits their initials.

The Highscores page can be accessed from the main page prior to starting. 

***NOTE: The Highscores are not ordered by points.
Feel free to send a pull request to order the Highscores.***
